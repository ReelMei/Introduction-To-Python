Introduction To Python Basics !!!


<!-- DOUBLE QUOTES -->
Text in Python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes:



<!-- PRINT WITHOUT A NEW LINE -->
By default, the print() function ends with a new line.
If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter......



<!-- PRINT NUMBERS -->
You can also use the print() function to display numbers:
However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:



<!-- Mix Text and Numbers -->
You can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma:


# Variable Names ##

     A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).       

# Rules for Python variables: ##

1)  A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2)  A variable name cannot start with a number
3)  A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4)  Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
5)  A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

## Python Type Conversion ##
** Type Conversion **
## You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:



## STRINGS

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello' is the same as "hello".
You can display a string literal with the print() function:

---   Multiline Strings ---
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes for long text to avoid line breaking!

## Python - Slicing Strings

--- Slicing ---
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

--- Slice From the Start ---
By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character.

--- Slice To the End ---
By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end.

--- Negative Indexing ---
Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string.
