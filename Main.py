# if 5 > 2:
#     print ("FIve is greater than 2")

# print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye Bye")


# print("Hello World!", end=" ")
# print("I will print on the same line.")


# print(6);
# print(358);


# # You can also do math inside the print() function:

# print(4+5);

# # You can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma:

# print("I am", 40, "years old")




# Variables ##

full_name = "John Smith"
age = 20
is_new = True
print(full_name)


# Input ##
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print('Hi ' + name )

# name = input('What is your name? ')
# color = input('What is your favourite color? ')
# print(name + ' likes ' + color)

# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(y)

# ## Type Conversion ##
# x = 1 # int
# y = 2.8 # float
# z = 1j # complex

# #convert from int to float:
# a = float(x)

# #convert from float to int:
# b = int(y)

# #convert from int to complex:
# c = complex(x)

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)1995

# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))

## Combining Input and Type Conversion ##

# birth_year = input('What is your birth year? ')
# age = 2024 - int(birth_year)
# print('Your age is: ' + str(age))
